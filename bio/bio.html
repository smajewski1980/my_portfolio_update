          Welcome to my portfolio! I am extremely interested in becoming a Web
          Developer/Computer Programmer for the Assembly. As an experienced
          Audio Video Engineer with a strong foundation in technical
          problem-solving and an effectiveness both independently and in a group
          setting, I am excited about the opportunity to transition into a new
          phase of my career and further contribute to the Assembly team.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my over twelve years in Radio/TV, I have developed a keen eye
          for detail and a deep understanding of complex systems. Over the years
          I have also honed my ability to communicate and collaborate
          effectively with various teams and departments. I have taken the
          initiative to learn computer programming skills through
          Codecademy.com, various blogs, articles, tutorials and lots of
          practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am enthusiastic about the chance to utilize my skills in a new
          capacity and believe that my dedication to the Assembly, combined with
          my passion for writing code, makes me a valuable asset. I would love
          the opportunity to discuss how I could contribute to your team.
